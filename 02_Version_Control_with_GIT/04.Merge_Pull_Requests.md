# Merge request and Pull request
* For that we have "merge request" or also called "pullrequest"
* It's basically a requesttomergeonebranchintoanother(usually in the main branch)
* Best Practice: Other developer reviews code changes before merging 
* Reviewer can see the changes made and either approve or decline the merge request
