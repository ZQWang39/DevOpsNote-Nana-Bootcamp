# What is Version Control?
* Also known as "source control"
* Practice of tracking and managing changes to software code
* It enables multiple people to simultaneously work on a single project
* Code is hosted centrally on the internet
* Every developer has an entire copy of the code locally

## Basic Concepts of Version Control
* Version Control keeps a history of changes
* Every code change and file is tracked
* You can revert commits
* Each change labelled with commit message
