# Concept of Branches 
* Branches are used for better collaboration
* A "main"branch(alsocalled"master") is created by default when a new repositoryis initialized
* Each developer can then create temporary branches e.g. for a feature or bugfix and work on it without worrying to break the main branch 
* Branch is basedonmainbranch. So, it starts from same codebase
* When finished, the complete branch can be merged backto the main branch 
* Goal is to have a stable main branch,ready for production deployment
