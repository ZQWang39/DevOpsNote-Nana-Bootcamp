# ECS
* Control Plane:managed by AWS
* Compute Fleet:Hosted on EC2 instances, connected and managed by ECS
* EC2 instance needs to have:
  * Container Runtime
  * ECS Agent - for Control Plane communication

## Using EC2 vs AWS Fargate
* ECS hosted on EC2 Instances:
  * Containers managed by AWS
  * Full access and control of your infrastructure
  * You still need to manage and maintain the virtual machine
  * Pay for whole server

* ECS hosted on AWS Fargate:
  * Containers managed by AWS
  * Infrastructure managed by AWS
  * Provisions servers on demand
  * Pay only for what you use
  * Easily scales up/down without fixed resources defined before hand
  * Serverless way to launch containers
