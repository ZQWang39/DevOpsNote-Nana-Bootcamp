# Modules
* A module allows you to logically organize your Python code, so it should contain related code
* Grouping related code into a module makes the code easier to understand and use
* Create a module: It's just a .py file consisting ofPython code. For examplehelper.py
* Use a module: To use the module, we need toimport it.
* You can also use existing modules
* Many useful ones, for exampledatetime module which have manydifferent functions that make iteasier for you to work with datesand times!

## Exercise
 ```python
# my_module.py
def my_function(arg):
    return arg * 2

class MyClass:
    pass

# main.py
import my_module

result = my_module.my_function(10)
print(result) # Output: 20

obj = my_module.MyClass()
```

```python
# main.py
from my_module import my_function

result = my_function(10)
print(result) # Output: 20
```
## Countdown App

The **`datetime`**
 module in Python is a built-in module that provides classes for manipulating dates and times.

[datetime - Basic date and time types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)

```python
from datetime import datetime

# Example 1: Current date and time
now = datetime.now()
print(now) # Output: 2022-12-29 10:45:32.564329

# Example 2: Extracting year, month, day, hour, minute, and second
print(now.year)    # Output: 2022
print(now.month)   # Output: 12
print(now.day)     # Output: 29
print(now.hour)    # Output: 10
print(now.minute)  # Output: 45
print(now.second)  # Output: 32

# Example 3: Creating a specific date
birthday = datetime(1998, 12, 25)
print(birthday) # Output: 1998-12-25 00:00:00

# Example 4: Calculating the difference between two dates
from datetime import timedelta
now = datetime.now()
diff = now - birthday
print(diff) # Output: datetime.timedelta(days=8359)

# Example:only keep the date, month, and year from a datetime object,
now = datetime.now()
print(now) # Output: 2022-12-29 10:45:32.564329

date_only = now.date()
print(date_only) # Output: 2022-12-29

#Another way to achieve this is by using the strftime() method of the datetime 
#object, it allows you to format the datetime object according to your need.

date_only = now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
print(date_only) # Output: 2022-12-29

#can also use the replace() method on the datetime object to set the time to 0

date_only = now.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
print(date_only) # Output: 2022-12-29 00:00:00
```
