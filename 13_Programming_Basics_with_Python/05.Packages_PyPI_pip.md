# Packages, PyPI and pip

## Package

A package in Python is a collection of modules that are organized in a hierarchical structure. Packages allow you to organize your code into related groups and make it more reusable and modular.

## PyPI

[PyPI Â· The Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/)

Python Package Index (PyPI), which is a public repository of Python packages.

## pip3

`pip3 install package_name`

**install a specific version of a package by specifying the version number:**

`pip3 install package_name==1.2.3`

**use pip to upgrade or uninstall packages**

```python
pip3 install --upgrade package_name
pip3 uninstall package_name
```

**Another way to install packages is by using `requirements.txt`
 file. This file contains a list of all the packages that your project needs and their versions. You can use the `pip install` command with the `-r`option to install all the packages in the `requirements.tx` file:**

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

**use `pip3`to list the packages that are currently installed in your system**

`pip3 list`

**use `pip3` to search for packages on the Python Package Index (PyPI)**

`pip3 search package_name`
