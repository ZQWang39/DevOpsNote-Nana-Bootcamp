# Object-oriented Programming 
* Python is a object oriented programming language
* Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties (or also called attributes) and methods(functions that belong to the object)

## Class & Object
A class is a blueprint for an object and it defines the properties and methods of the object.

An object is a data structure that contains data and methods. An object is an instance of a class, and it encapsulates the state and behavior of that class.

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def speak(self):
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")

p1 = Person("John", 30)
p2 = Person("Jane", 25)

p1.speak()
p2.speak()
```

Demo:

`user.py`

```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, user_email, name, password, current_job_title):
        self.email = user_email
        self.name = name
        self.password = password
        self.current_job_title = current_job_title

    def change_password(self, new_password):
        self.password = new_password

    def change_job_title(self, new_job_title):
        self.current_job_title = new_job_title

    def get_user_info(self):
        print(f"User {self.name} currently works as a {self.current_job_title}. You can contact them at {self.email}")
```

`post.py`

```python
class Post:
    def __init__(self, message, author):
        self.message = message
        self.author = author

    def get_post_info(self):
        print(f"Post: {self.message} written by {self.author}")
```

`main.py`

```python
from user import User
from post import Post

app_user_one = User("nn@nn.com", "Nana Janashia", "pwd1", "DevOps Engineer")
app_user_one.get_user_info()

app_user_two = User("aa@aa.com", "James Bond", "supersecret", "Agent")
app_user_two.get_user_info()

new_post = Post("on a secret mission today", app_user_two.name)
new_post.get_post_info()
```
