# Introduction to Prometheus

* Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system and alertingtoolkit
* Prometheus is used widely and has an active community
* It gathers, organizes, and stores metrics as time series data from targets by "scraping" metrics HTTP endpoints
* Can trigger alerts when specified conditions are observed

## Why we need a monitoring tool 

* ### Visibility in different environments
  * You need visibility in all kinds ofenvironments, but especially in highlydynamic container environment, which is morechallenging to monitor
  * For that you need tools like Prometheus, whichare designed for monitoring these types of environments
* ### Visibility on different levels
  * When you have 100s or 1000s of containers, pluscomponents on multiple levels (infrastructure,platform, application) you need a way to have avisibility and consistent monitoring across all thesecomponents
  * Without visibility, it's a black box for you. When thingsbreak inside your complex environment, you have noidea what is happening. You don't know what hascaused the issue, what is not working

* ### Example Use Case
   * Problems:
      * Many application errors appear in frontend to the end user. They only see the error message, but the cause can be anyof the many components in the backend
   * Solutions:
      * Monitoring can help identifying the problem quickly with little effortInstead of manually trying to troubleshoot across multiplecomponents, it will help exactly pin point directly to the root cause.
