# Core Kubernetes Components 
Kubernetes has many components, but these are the main ones you need to know:

## Pod
* Group of 1 or more containers
* Smallest unit of K8s
* An abstraction over container
* Usually 1 application/container per Pod
* Pods are ephemeral
* New IP address assigned on re-creation

## Service
* Basically a static or permanent IP address that can be attached to each Pod
* Also serves as a loadbalancer
* Lifecycles of Service and Pod are not connected
* If Pod crashes, the Service and its IP address will be the same
* Internal Service: By default, for example a database, which should not be accessible rom outside
* External Service: Application accessible through browser

## Ingress
* Ingress is the entrypoint to your K8s cluster
* Request goes to Ingress first, which does the forwarding to the Service

## Configmap
* To store non-confidentialdata in key-value pairs


## Secret
* Similar to ConfigMap, but tostore sensitive data such aspasswords or tokens

## Volume
* Volume component basically attaches a physical storage on a hard drive to your Pod
* Storage could be either on a local server or outside the K8s cluster

## Deployment
* lueprint for Pods
* You work with Deployments and by defining the number of replicas, K8s creates Pods

## Statefulset
* Blueprint for stateful applications
* Like databases etc
* In addition to replicating features,StatefulSet makes sure database reads and writes are synchronized to avoid data inconsistencies
