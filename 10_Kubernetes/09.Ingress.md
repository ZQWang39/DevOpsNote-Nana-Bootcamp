# Ingress

* External Services are a way to access applications in K8s from outside
* In production a better alternative is Ingress!
* Not a Service type, but acts as the entry point for your cluster
* More intelligent and flexible: Let's you consolidate your routing rules into a single resource as itcan expose multiple services under the same IP address
* Configure multiple sub-domains or domains
* Configure multiple paths for same host

## How to configure Ingress in your cluster
* need an implementation for Ingress
* Which is Ingress Controller: 
  * Evaluates all the rules
  * Manages redirections
  * Entry point to the cluster
  * Many third-party implementations
  * K8s Nginx Ingress Controller

## Before Ingress Controller you still need 1 load balancer
* Option 1 - Cloud service provider: have out-of-the-box K8s solutions
* Option 2 - Bare Metal: You need to configure some kind of entry point. Eitherinside the cluster or outside as separate server
