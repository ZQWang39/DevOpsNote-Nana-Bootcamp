# Managed Kubernetes Service

## Kubernetes on Cloud platform
2 options to create a Kubernetes cluster on a cloud platform
* Create own cluster from scratch
  * You need to manage everythingyourself
  * Not practical, when you want to setup things fast and easy
* Use Managed K8s Service
  * You only care about Worker Nodes
  * Everything pre-installed
  * Control Plane Nodes created and managed by cloud provider
  * You only pay for the Worker Nodes
  * Use cloud native load balancer for Ingress controller
  * Use cloud storage
  * Less effort and time

## Example Managed Kubernetes Services
* AWS: Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
* Azure: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
* Google: Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
* Linode: Linode Kubernetes Engine (LKE)
