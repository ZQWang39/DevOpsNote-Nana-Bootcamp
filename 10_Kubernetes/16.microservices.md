# Microservices in Kubernetes

## Introduction to Microservices
* Microservices are an architectural approach to software development
* Software is composed of small independent services (instead of having a huge monolith)
* Each business functionality is encapsulated into own Microservice (MS)

## Benefits
* Each MS can be developed, packaged and releasedindependently
* Changes in 1 MS doesn't affect other MS
* Less interconnected logic, loosely coupled
* Each MS can be developed by separate developer teams

## Communication between Microservices
* Communication between those services can happen in different ways:
  * Service-to-Service API Calls: Direct communication
  * Message-Based Communication: Communication through amessage broker, like Rabbitmqor Redis
  * Service Mesh Architecture: Platform layer on top of theinfrastructure layer,like Istio,Linkerd, HashiCorp ConsulEnables managed, observableand secure communication
