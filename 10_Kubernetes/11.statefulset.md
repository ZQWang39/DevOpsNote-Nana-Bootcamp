# Statefulset
* Used to manage stateful applications, like databases
* Manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods

## Stateless Applications
* Doesn't depend on previous data
* Deployed using Deployment

## Stateful Applications
* Update data based on previous data
* Query data
* Depends on most up-to-date data/state

## Deployment vs StatefulSet
* Unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity foreach of their Pods
* These pods are created from the same spec, but are not interchangeable: each has a persistent identifier that it maintains across any rescheduling
* Pods created fromStatefulSet:
  * More difficult
  * Can't be created/deleted atsame time
  * Can't be randomly addressed
* Pods created from Deployment
  * Identical and interchangeable
  * Created in random order with random hashes
  * 1 Service that load balances to any Pod

## Scaling database applications
* Only 1 replica, can make changes
* So replicas are not identical
* Each replica has its own storage
* These storages are constantly synchronized
