# Volumes
* K8s offers no data persistence out of the box
* At its core, a volume is a directory (with some data in it), which is accessible to the containers in a Pod
* K8s supports many types of volumes
* Ephemeral volume types have a lifetime of a Pod, persistent volumes exist beyond the lifetime of a Pod
* In this lecture we talk about persistent volumes, with these storage requirements:
  * Storage that doesn't depend on pod life cycle
  * Storage must be available on all Nodes
  * Storage needs to survive even if cluster crashes


## The way to persist data in K8s using Volumes need 3 resurces

* ### Persistent Volume (PV)
Storage in the cluster that has been provisioned byan administrator or dynamically provisioned usingStorage Classes
* ### Storage Class (SC)
SC provisions PV dynamically when PVC claims it
* ### Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)
A request for storage by a user, Similar to Pods. While Pods consume noderesources, PVCs consume PV resources

## Persistent Volume
* Persistent Volumes are NOTnamespaced, soPV resource isaccessible to the whole cluster
* Depending on storage type, specattributes differ

## Persistent Volume Claim
* Request for storage by a user
* Claims can request specific size and access modes (e.g. they can be mountedReadWriteOnce, ReadOnlyMany or ReadWriteMany).

## Storage Class
Provisions PV dynamically
