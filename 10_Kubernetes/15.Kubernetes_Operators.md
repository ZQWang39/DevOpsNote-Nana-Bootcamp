# Kubernetes Operators 
* Stateful applications need constant management and syncing after deployment. So stateful applications, like database need to be operated
* Instead of a human operator, you have an automated scripted operator
* Stateless applications:Is managed by Kubernetes
* Stateful applications:sK8s can't automate the process natively

## How it works:
* Control loop mechanism
* Makes use of CRD's
* Include domain/App-specific-knowledge, e.g. mysql:
  * How to create mysql cluster
  * How to run it
  * How to synchronize the data
  * How to update
