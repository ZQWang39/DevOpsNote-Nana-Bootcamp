# Kubernetes architecture

Worker nodes and Control Plane


* ## Worker Node
  * The containerized applications run on the Worker Nodes
  * Each Node runs multiple Pods on it
  * Much more compute resources needed, because the actual workload runs on the
  * Each worker node needs to have 3 processes installed:
     * Container Runtime: Software responsible forrunning containers. For example containerd, CRI-Oor Docker
     * Kubelet: Agent that makes surecontainers are running in a Pod. Talks to underlying server (toget resources for Pod) andcontainer runtime (to startcontainers in Pod)
     * Kube-proxy: A network proxy withintelligent forwarding ofrequests to the Pods

* ## Control Plane
  * Manages the Worker Nodes and the Pods in the cluster
  * Much more important and needs to be replicated
  * So in production, replicas run across multiple machines
  * Each control plane needs to have 4 processes installed:
    * API server:The cluster gateway - singleentrypoint to the clusterActs as a gatekeeper forauthentication, validating the requestClients to interact with the API server:UI, API or CLI
    * Scheduler: Decides on which Node new Podshould be scheduledFactors taken into account forscheduling decisions: resourcerequirements, hardware/software/policy constraints, data locality
    * Controller Manager: Detects state changes, like crashingof Pods and tries to recover thecluster state as soon as possibleFor that it makes request to theScheduler to reschedule those Podsand the same cycle happens
    * etcd: K8s' backing store for all cluster data. Aconsistent, high-available key-value store. All other processes like Scheduler, Controller Manager etc work basedon the data in etcd as well as communicate with each other through etcdstore

  * Control Plane makes global decisions about the cluster
  * Detects and responds to cluster events

## Increase Kubernetes Cluster Capacity
As your application grows and its demand for resources increases, you may actually add more Nodes  to yourcluster, thus forming a more powerful and robust cluster to meet your application resource requirements.
 * ### Add a Control Plane Node
   * Get a fresh new server
   * Install all control plane processes on it
   * Join it to the K8s cluster using a K8s commands
 * ### Add a Worker Node
   * Get a fresh new server
   * Install all the Worker Node processes, like container runtime, Kubelet and KubeProxy on it
   * Join it to the K8s cluster using a K8s command
