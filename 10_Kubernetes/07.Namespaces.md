# Namespace

* Namespaces provide a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster
* Names of resources need to be unique within a namespace, but not across namespaces
* Like a virtual cluster inside a cluster

## Use Cases for when to use namespaces:
* Group resources logically, instead of having all in the "default" namespace
* Isolate team resources, to avoid conflicts
* Share resources between different environments
* Limit permissions and computeresources for teams

## Cluster-wide resources
There are resources, which can't be created within a namespace, called cluster-wide resources
* Live globally in a cluster, you can't isolate them
* Low-level resources, like Volumes, Nodes
