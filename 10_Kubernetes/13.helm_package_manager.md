# Helm - Package Manager
* Helm is the package manager for Kubernetes. Think of it like apt/yum for Kubernetes
* Packages YAML files and distributes them in public and private repositories

## Helm 
* Tool that installs and manages K8s applications
* This is done via Charts, so Helm manages these Charts

## Helm chart
* Helm package that contain description of the package `Chart.yaml`
* 1 or more templates, which contain K8s manifest files
* You can create your own Helm Charts with Helm, push to Helm Repository
* Download and use existing ones

## Why Helm Charts?
Instead of everyone creating their ownK8s config files, 1 bundle of all neededK8s manifests

## Use existing official Charts:
Many of these created by the official sources.Mysql Chart from Mysql or ElasticSearch Chartfrom ElasticSearch

## Sharing Helm Charts
* Charts are hosted on their own repositories
* There are public repos, but you can have own private repos in your company.

## Helm as Templating Engine 
Helm renders the templates and communicateswith the Kubernetes API
