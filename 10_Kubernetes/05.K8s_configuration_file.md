# K8s YAML Configuration File 

* Also called "Kubernetes manifest"
* Declarative: A manifest specifies thedesired state of a K8s component
* Config files are in YAML format, which is user-friendly,but strict indentation
* Config files should be stored in version control

## Each configuration file has 3 parts

* ### Metadata
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx

```
* ### Specification
Attributes of "spec" are specific to the kind
```
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    
```
* ### status
Automatically generated and added by KubernetesK8s gets this information from etcd, which holds the current status of any K8s component

* ### Deployment Configuration File
Deployment Configuration is a bit special. Since it's an abstraction over Pod, we have the Pod configuration inside Deploymentcon figuration Own "metadata" and "spec" section Blueprint for Pod

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata: <--
      labels:<--
        app: nginx<--
    spec:<--
      containers:<--
      - name: nginx<--
        image: nginx:1.16<--
        ports:<--
        - containerPort: 8080<--
```
 * ### Labels & Selectors
   * labels: Labels are key/value pairs that are attached to resources, such as Pods.Used to specify identifying attributes that are meaningful and relevant to users
   ```
   metadata: 
      labels:
        app: nginx
    ```
    * Label Selectors: Labels do not provide uniquenessVia selector the user can identify a set of resources

* ### Ports in Service and Pod
In Service component you need to specify:
port = the port where the service itself is accessible
target Port = port, the container accepts traffic on
In Deployment component:
containerPort = port, the container accepts traffic on
