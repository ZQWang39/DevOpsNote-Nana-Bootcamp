# Publish an artifact
1. Build jar or zip package
2. Push to artifact repository to save those packages for later use or for downloading on a remoteserver
3. Then you can download (curl, wget) it anywhere.

## Change in how we use artifacts
* We don't keep jar or zip files, because we have Docker
* We don't build them locally, because we have Jenkins and other Build Automation Tools

## Build Tools and Docker 
* No need to build and move different artifact types (e.g. Jar, War, Zip)->Just 1 Docker Image
* No need for a repository for each file type -> just one docker image
* No need to install dependencies on the server -> Execute install command inside Docker Image
