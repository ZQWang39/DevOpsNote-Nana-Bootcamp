* Each user account contains 2 unique identifiers: username and UID
* When a user account is created, its username is mapped to a unique UID

### username
Is used to access the user account, aka login name, it's flexible, can be changed.

### UID = iser identifier
A number assigned by Linux to each user on the system, it's fixed, cannot be changed.

### 3 types of user accounts:
* superuser
* user accounts
* service accounts

### 2 ways to manage user accounts
* Linux - Standalone management
