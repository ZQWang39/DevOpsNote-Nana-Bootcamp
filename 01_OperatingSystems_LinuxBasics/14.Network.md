# Network
__Any devices need 3 pieces of data for comunication:__

* ## IP address
  * CIDR block
* ## Subnet
Logical subdivision of an IP network
* ## Gateway
IP address of router

* ## NAT
__Network Address Traslation__
NAT is a way to map multiple local private addresses to public one before transferring the information, hence if you make request to the internet, the router will replace your private IP with the router's IP. <br/>

__Benefits__
* Security
* Reuse IP addresses

* ## Firewall
Prevents unauthorized traffic from accessing private network. 

* ## Port
Every devices has a set of ports, these ports are unique on a device, we can control which ports are open from receving external traffic which are not.

* ## DNS 
DNS translates domain name to IP address
 * How does DNS resolution work:
 When enter a domain in a browser, a DNS client on our computer needs to look up the correspoding IP address. 
 * It queries DNS servers to resolve the name.
 A client can sometimes answer the query locally by using cached information from previuos query. Or DNS server can use its own cache of resource record information to answer the query. 
 * Request flow: <br/>
   Browser cache, Name server cache(network providers)<br/>
   ↓<br/>
   Root server(saves top level domains)<br/>
   ↓<br/>
   Top level domain server(stores information for top level domains)<br/>
   ↓<br/>
   authoritative name server(provided by DNS providers)<br/>
   ↓<br/>
   IP address<br/>
