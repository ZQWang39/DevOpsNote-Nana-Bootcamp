# Docker Image vs Docker Container

## Docker image

* The actual package (file)
* Artifact that can be moved around
* Not in "running" state
* Consists of several layers
* Mostly Linux Base Image, application image on top

## Docker container
* Actually starts the application
* Is a running environment defined in the image
* Virtual file system 
* Port binding: talk to application running inside of container
