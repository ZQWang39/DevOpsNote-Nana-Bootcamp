# Ansible Roles
In Ansible, a role is a pre-defined set of tasks, handlers, templates, files, and variables that can be reused across multiple playbooks. A role encapsulates all the tasks required to perform a particular configuration or action, and it can be easily shared with other Ansible users.

A role can include one or more of the following directories:

- **`tasks/`**: contains the main tasks that the role will perform.
- **`handlers/`**: contains handlers, which are tasks that only run when notified by other tasks.
- **`templates/`**: contains templates that will be used to generate files that the role will use.
- **`files/`**: contains static files that will be copied to the target hosts.
- **`vars/`**: contains variables that the role will use.
- **`defaults/`**: contains default variable values for the role.
- **`meta/`**: contains metadata for the role, such as dependencies on other roles.

Roles can be included in a playbook by specifying the path to the role directory, or by installing the role in the **`roles/`** directory of the Ansible project.

Using roles can make it easier to organize and reuse code, and can also help to make playbooks more modular and maintainable. By using roles, you can avoid duplicating code across multiple playbooks, and you can easily share your code with other Ansible users.
